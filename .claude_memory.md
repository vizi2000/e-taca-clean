# E-Taca Donation Platform - Project Memory

## Project Overview
E-Taca is a donation platform with Fiserv payment integration, built with Next.js frontend and .NET backend.

## Key Architecture
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, glass morphism UI
- **Backend**: .NET 8 API with Entity Framework Core
- **Payment**: Fiserv integration with webhook support and HMACSHA256 security
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with optimized queries and caching
- **Deployment**: Docker containers with production configurations

## Recent Changes (2025-08-28)
- Modified Docker configurations for production deployment
- Updated frontend pages (admin dashboard, donation page)
- Enhanced payment service with production-ready security
- Optimized admin statistics with caching and pagination
- Added Playwright testing setup with CI/CD pipeline

## Important Files
- `src/ETaca.API/Services/PaymentService.cs` - Fiserv payment integration
- `src/ETaca.API/Services/AdminStatisticsService.cs` - Admin dashboard backend
- `frontend/app/admin/page.tsx` - Admin dashboard UI
- `frontend/app/[slug]/page.tsx` - Dynamic donation pages
- `docker-compose.yml` - Container orchestration

## Security Considerations
- Webhook signature validation implemented
- Idempotency protection for payments
- Role-based access control for admin
- Environment variables for sensitive data
- HMACSHA256 for request verification

## Testing Setup
- Playwright for E2E testing
- Visual regression testing configured
- GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline ready

## Documentation System
- BorgDB integration active for continuous documentation
- Session tracking in `/borgDB/sessions/`
- Automatic capture of code changes and debugging sessions
- Content creation opportunities being tracked

## Next Steps
- Complete testing implementation
- Deploy to production environment
- Monitor payment webhook reliability
- Optimize database performance further
